# Ace-Attorney-Tools
A repository dedicated to studying the various formats used in the Ace Attorney series. An importer script for Autodesk 3DS Max will also be developed once the required formats are reverse-engineered and implemented.

## Templates
Templates to help view information on file formats are for use in 010 Editor. If you have an addition to the templates, you can make a pull request or contact me on Discord.

Supported formats: .lcm, .lmt, .mod

## 3DS Max Script
A 3DS Max script will be developed using tge's UMvC3-tools as a base. All generally stable edits of the maxscript will be pushed as releases. If something is broken that was missed, create an issue or contact The Ripping Resource Discord.
3DS Max versions supported: 2023

### Installation
1. Download the most recent release published.
2. To setup the maxscript, navigate to src/python/mtio/modules/mtmax, and run the setup.bat located inside. 
3. Open 3DS Max, and go to Scripting -> Run Script. From there, navigate to src/python/mtio/modules/mtmax, and run plugin.py.
